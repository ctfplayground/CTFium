Welcome to a full chain browser exploitation challenge. Just that it is not a browser. Its just a stupid curl maybe. But still it is a full chain exploitation challenge

We are gonna be streaming your exploits hence you need to pop a calculator on the livestream. DM the author when you are ready and send over your script.

The covid binary will be present in the same folder as the exploit file and we only accept python source code

OS: Ubuntu 16.04

docker pull iamalsaher/pwndock:2.23 in case you dont want to download the OS

Our same exploit runs on both Ubuntu Desktop and Docker images so you can freely test on either.

We also offer 3 attempts to each team with a maximum of 3 minutes per attempt.
